# **Grocery Tracker Web Application**

## **Overview**
This project is a personal initiative to solve a real-life problem: keeping track of the groceries I have at home. It allows users to **view, create, update, and delete grocery items**. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to leverage its popularity, extensive resources, and active community support.

## **Motivation**
As someone passionate about learning and web development, I wanted to apply my knowledge to build a web application from scratch. This project reflects my dedication to problem-solving and self-improvement, demonstrating my ability to create a functional, user-centric application while continuously learning and refining my skills.

## **Features**
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can add, update, delete, and view grocery items.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive design for seamless interaction.

## **Challenges**
- **Frontend Design**: Designing a visually appealing and functional user interface was a significant challenge, highlighting the need for further improvement in frontend development skills.
- **End-to-End Development**: Managing both backend and frontend aspects of the application required me to learn and adapt quickly to various tools and frameworks.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Code Optimization**:
   - Debug, test, document, and comment the existing code.
   - Modularize the code for better maintainability and scalability.
2. **Notification System**:
   - Implement a system to notify users when items are nearing their expiration dates.
3. **Multi-User Support**:
   - Enable multiple users to create accounts and manage their grocery items independently.
4. **Computer Vision Integration**:
   - Utilize computer vision algorithms to automatically track grocery items and their expiration dates by scanning receipts or labels.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grocery-tracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd grocery-store
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Start the client side:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: React.js, Chakra UI, Chakra Icons
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Git, Github, Postman (For testing API endpoints)


## **Lessons Learned**
- Building a project from scratch requires continuous learning and problem-solving.
- Effective time management and prioritization are crucial in balancing multiple tasks like design, coding, and debugging.
- Recognizing the value of clean code, modularization, and proper documentation for project scalability.
